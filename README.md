### IPL Score Prediction
This project aims to predict the scores of IPL matches using machine learning techniques. The Indian Premier League is a professional Twenty20 cricket league in India, and this project utilizes historical match data to train a model that can predict the final scores of future matches.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of historical IPL match data. Each record in the dataset contains information about a particular match, including details such as team names, venue, toss winner, toss decision, and final scores. The dataset is split into a training set and a test set, with the training set used to train the prediction model and the test set used to evaluate the model's performance.

# Model
The prediction model is built using machine learning techniques, specifically regression algorithms. The model takes into account various features from the match data, such as team performance, venue, and toss outcomes, to predict the final scores of matches. The model is trained on the training dataset and then tested on the test dataset to assess its accuracy and performance.
